Night syk is dark.
Moon shines bright.
I don't know where to go
nobody's in sight.

I hear a howl
it's vampires plight
no hunt tonight, it seems
'cuz there's nobody in sight.

I hear the growl
now closer than ever,
silver fur shining
in this moonlit night.

The pack moves in closer
I know I can't fight.
I must run now
but there's no escape in sight.

Blood in my veins have dried
and I need a fresh supply
to survive what is to come
in this bloody night.

The beast pounces on me
pinning me to the ground
its claws bore deep in my chest
and jaw ready to bite.

The pack howls in unison
and a gunshot it invites,
snarling the beasts
now retract in the night.

I snigger and I smile
for the sky is dark tonight,
the moon shines bright
and finally, I have my prey in sight!
