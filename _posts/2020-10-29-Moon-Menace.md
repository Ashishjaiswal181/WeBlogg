Night syk is dark.<br />
Moon shines bright.<br />
I don't know where to go<br />
nobody's in sight.<br />

I hear a howl<br />
it's vampires plight<br />
no hunt tonight, it seems<br />
'cuz there's nobody in sight.<br />

I hear the growl<br />
now closer than ever,<br />
silver fur shining<br />
in this moonlit night.<br />

The pack moves in closer<br />
I know I can't fight.<br />
I must run now<br />
but there's no escape in sight.<br />

Blood in my veins have dried<br />
and I need a fresh supply<br />
to survive what is to come<br />
in this bloody night.<br />

The beast pounces on me<br />
pinning me to the ground<br />
its claws bore deep in my chest<br />
and jaw ready to bite.<br />

The pack howls in unison<br />
and a gunshot it invites,<br />
snarling the beasts<br />
now retract in the night.<br />

I snigger and I smile<br />
for the sky is dark tonight,<br />
the moon shines bright<br />
and finally, I have my prey in sight!<br />
