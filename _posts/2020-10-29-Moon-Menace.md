Night syk is dark
moon shines bright
I don't know where to go
nobody's in sight

I hear a howl
it's vampire's plight
no hunt tonight, it seems
'cuz there's nobody in sight

I hear the growl
now closer than ever
silver fur shining
in this moonlit night

the pack moves in closer
I know I can't fight
I must run now
but there's no escape in sight

blood in my veins have dried
and I need a fresh supply
to survive what is to come
in this bloody night

the beast pounces on me
pinning me to the ground
its claws bore deep in my chest
and jaw ready to bite

the pack howls in unison
and a gunshot, it invites
snarling the beasts
now, retract in the night

I snigger and I smile
for the sky is dark tonight
the moon shines bright
and finally, I have a prey in my sight!
