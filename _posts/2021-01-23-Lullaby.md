I never really grew up<br />
as the years passed by.<br />
I was stuck<br />
in my own lullaby.<br />
When I find these people<br />
all grave and serious,<br />
I just want to be carefree<br />
but they get furious.<br />

No I'm not stupid<br /> 
nor am I dumb,<br />
I'm just a little quirky<br />
and a little curious.<br />

Is it so difficult<br />
for them to understand,<br />
Man is just a child<br />
stretched over in time?<br />
Why can't I be myself?<br />
Why can't I be free?<br />
Why do I have to be a part of<br />
this society, and it's tragedy?<br />
