Hola amigos! Bold of you to assume that there really is much 'About Me' to actually read. But as you're already here I will let you be my guest. Get yourself a coffee or tea if you'd like before we get started on this marvelous story about me and how this blog came into being.
Long long ago I was born in the north-east India (but not very long ago either) and nothing peculiar happened! Early childhood? We will skip that in this brief introduction... 

Let me take you to my early teens in the wilderness of the evergreen forests on the hill station of Darjeeling. I think that gives you quite a good picture of the fun and exciting teenage I had. And to add on to it, I was there in a boarding school - non-coed (luckily or not, I'll let you be the judge).

The first book that I read was 'Heidi' by Johanna Spyri. Well..., it wasn't the first book I read but it was the book that got me into books and contemplation (Sigh!).

Ignoring the years of "teenage Shenanigans" we are here in Bangalore - of all places. Under the guidance of my elder brother, who is the creator of this blog website ( I mean he is the main guy here. I am just trying to put the overstated ICSE English to some use here), I was exposed to some serious media content which I was completely oblivious about, viz. Deathnote, Vanilla Sky, Mr. Church, and also the legendary Chuck Norris.

 After the "Brief introduction" about who I am I must tell you how this blog came into being. One day I let my brother read some of the "things" that I had written and he liked it. And being a Computer and Software Engineer ( he forced me to write it ), he said that he would make me a blog. So nearly after one year since that "incident", we are finally on to it while the world remains consumed in eternal lethargy and widespread Corona Virus.
 
Oh, and I am Aditya and... it was nice to meet you too.
